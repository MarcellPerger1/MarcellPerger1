- 👋 Hi, I’m  Marcell Perger
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, maths and chess ♟

  - Svelte (currently learning)
  - Vue (well at least I knew some a year ago)
- HTML/CSS
- Java (if I really have to)
- C (though I haven't written C code in ages)
- C++
- A bit of Rust 🦀 (the elegant higher-level side, not really the lower-level lifetimes stuff)
- Bash (though rather basic stuff only)

Other tools/skills I know/use:
- Git
- Github :octocat: (well, obviously):
  - Isuues, PRs, all the basics
  - Github projects
  - Github actions
- Googling/Google-fu (if I don't know something I Google it)

  - ESLint
  - Jest
  - Puppeteer
  - Prettier

- IDEs:
  - Pycharm

I should really create a blog or something...
